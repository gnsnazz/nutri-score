# NutriScore AI

**NutriScore AI** is a neuro-symbolic framework designed to classify the nutritional quality of food products(healthy vs unhealthy) by bridging the gap between deductive logic and statistical learning.

The system utilizes a **Prolog-based knowledge base** to infer semantic features from raw nutritional data. These logic-derived features enrich the training set for **Machine Learning algorithms**.

This hybrid approach allows the classifiers, to detect complex unhealthy patterns that traditional statistical models might miss. The final result is a robust system that achieves high accuracy by combining domain-specific nutritional rules with the generalization power of data-driven AI.
